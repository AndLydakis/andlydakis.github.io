This paper presents a personalized system for detecting irregular gait parameters that may lead to a fall.We separate the system into two distinct components. The first component is used to detect the current gait
phase of the wearer based on the incoming sensor data. The
second component combines the sensor data with the label
produced by the first component used to classify the gait as
regular or irregular in a manner that may potentially lead
to a fall. The system can identify the occurrence of three
distinct gait irregularities that may lead to a fall: small step
width, low foot clearance and excessive trunk sway. For this,
we use an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS).
The system was trained on three healthy subjects to evaluate its ability to identify irregular gait. Results show that
the system can provide real time results with an accuracy
equal or greater to similar systems in the existing literature.
