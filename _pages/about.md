I am a software engineer that thrives on working on every aspect of robotics. I have been involved
in a variety of different projects, ranging from home assistant robots, to wind-turbine cleaning rovers and wearable
rehabilitation solutions. I take pride in being able to quickly pick up new concepts and adapt to provide robust components
that I can integrate into complete systems.

Providing HRI that is safe and intuitive is my main interest. Whether that is providing machine-learning-based personalised rehabilitation models,
user detection and monitoring, gesture and voice-based communication, I believe that HRI should be easy to understand, robust
to misuse and provide the sense that the user is communicating with a smart piece of equipment that is capable of accomplishing
its intended goal. Having 

The majority of my experience has been ROS development in C++ and Python, but along the way I have picked up a few skills,
including Gazebo and Unity simulation, experience with Deep Learning frameworks such as Keras and Pytorch and graphics 
manipulation using OpenGL and VTK. I have also worked with CAN bus communication, and have experience in Arduino Programming.
