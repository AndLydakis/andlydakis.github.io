I am a software engineer that thrives on working on every aspect of autonomous applications. I have been involved
in a variety of different projects, ranging from home assistant robots, to wind-turbine cleaning rovers and wearable
rehabilitation solutions. I am currently working on the onboard simulation for autonomous trucks at Scania. Some of our vehicles are already out there mining on their own!  

I take pride in being able to quickly pick up new concepts and adapt to provide robust components
that I can integrate into complete systems.

Human interacting with autonomous agents in a manner that is safe and intuitive is my main interest. Whether that is providing robust human-robot interaction, or verifiably safe autonomous vehicles, I consider it a high priority goal to aim for when looking towards the future.  

The majority of my experience has been ROS development in C++ and Python, but along the way I have picked up a few skills,
including Gazebo and Unity simulation, experience with Deep Learning frameworks such as Keras and Pytorch and graphics 
manipulation using OpenGL and VTK. I have also worked with CAN bus communication, and have experience in Arduino Programming.

My latest experiences have been experimenting with running ML models on Databricks and exploring how LLMs Work
